Presented at the 2024 International System Dynamics Conference, Bergen, Norway

## Model
The Developmental Transitions model of dynamics of cognitive vulnerability and family support is a “proof of concept” model where the primary purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of using system dynamics to develop feedback theories in developmental psychology. Details of the model and documentation are described in [Hovmand et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-022-00395-3) and [the CCFP22 release on GitHub](https://github.com/CBSDLab/Developmental_Transitions/tree/CCFP22).
